# OpenMouse landing page

The standalone marketing/support site for OpenMouse, deployed at
[openmouse.app](https://openmouse.app). This is a separate Cloudflare Pages
project from the gated control app (control.openmouse.app), which lives in
the [openmouse](https://github.com/OpenMouse-Project/openmouse) repo.

## Pages

- `landing.html` — the marketing home page
- `faq.html` — frequently asked questions
- `check.html` — WebHID compatibility checker
- `supported.html` — supported device list, with mouse request/voting
- `donate.html` — support/funding page

## Stack

Vite + Preact + TypeScript, no build-time server framework. `functions/api/*`
are Cloudflare Pages Functions backing the mouse request/vote/config
endpoints used by `supported.html`. `supabase/migrations/*` defines the
Postgres tables those functions read and write.

## Developing

```sh
npm install
npm run dev      # local dev server
npm run build    # type-check + production build
npm test         # unit tests
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in a Supabase project URL/anon key to
exercise the request/vote flow locally.

The Donate page reads its contributor list from `public/contributors.json`
instead of spending each visitor's anonymous GitHub API quota. The
`update-contributors.yml` workflow refreshes that snapshot daily; run
`node scripts/update-contributors.mjs` to update it locally.

## Scope

This repo intentionally contains only the public marketing/support pages and
their dependencies. The gated control app, its device drivers, and the admin
dashboard are out of scope here — see the `openmouse` repo instead.
